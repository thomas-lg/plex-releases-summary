# The entrypoint is invoked as root so it can adjust file ownership/permissions
# according to the requested PUID/PGID before the main process starts. This
# briefly increases the attack surface during initialization, so the logic in
# entrypoint.sh must remain minimal, well-audited, and should drop privileges
# with gosu to the unprivileged user (appuser) as early as possible.
